In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder
    text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a 
    typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as 
    a placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily 
    replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider
     the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.
   Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum,
    a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered,
     added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.
