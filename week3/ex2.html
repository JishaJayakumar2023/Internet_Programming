In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder
     text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a 
     typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as 
     a placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily 
     replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider
      the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.
    Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum,
     a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered,
      added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.
